# _1. Brief introduction of Cloud computing._
* Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. It goes back to the days of flowcharts and presentations that would represent the gigantic server's infrastructure of the Internet as nothing but a unstructured network accepting connections and giving out information as it floats. Cloud computing is a term used to describe the use of hardware and software delivered via network.

# _2. Why do we use Cloud computing?_
* Cloud computing used for computing based on the internet. In the past, people would run applications or programs from software downloaded on a physical computer or server in their building. Cloud computing allows people access to the same kinds of applications through the internet 
Some of the benefits of cloud computing are:-

  * _Efficiency_
  * _Cost reduction_
  * _Data security_
  * _Scalability_
  * _Mobility_

  

# _3. What is the basic concept of GitHub?_
* GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. 
It connects the developers and coders from all over the world with each other to share knowledge and work together.
# _4. How GitHub is useful from perspective of Job and placement?_
* GitHub is a repository where you can post all your technical stuffs. It is like your technical profile where one can see all your progress related to technical skills. If one share the link of its GitHub account on resume then the selector directly check your technical skills through your account. They can track your contribution abd ratings on your work.
# _5. How we can use GitHub, and what are the features of GitHub?_
* GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects. It allows you to share your code and edit in others code. You can use this essential features provided by GitHub and perform a lot of task.
  * _Repository:-_
    * A GitHub repository can be used to store a development * project.
  * _Branch:-_
    * A GitHub branch is used to work with different versions of a repository at the same time.
  * _Pull Requests:-_
    * Requests are use to propose request to merge our changes.
  * _Commit:-_
    * We can accept the committed changes by this.

# _6. What is markdown language?_
* Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. When we create a Markdown-formatted file, we add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. 
<br>Symbols like #,>,_ and many more are used to define a particular style or formatting. Html tags can also be used to insert list, tables, images etc.
<br>One example of this formatting is given below:
* __Syntax:-__ 
<br>| Syntax      | Description |
<br>  | ----------- | ----------- |
<br>  | Header      | Title       |
<br>  | Paragraph   | Text        |
<br>

* __Result:-__
  | Syntax      | Description |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Header      | Title       |
  | Paragraph   | Text        |






# _7. What do mean by centralised system?_
* Centralized systems are systems that use client/server architecture where one or more client nodes are directly connected to a central server. This is the most commonly used type of system in many organisations where client sends a request to a company server and receives the response.

  * _Example:-_
    * Consider when we request a site to ahe web server, and it loads for us that site. Then we are Web client and server who is providing the data is working as a centralised system for a all the web clients.

# _Benefits of Cloud computing_
* There are lots of benefits of using cloud computing. It is very user friendly and makes easier to store and access data on any system around the globe.
<br> Following are the benefits of cloud computing are:-
  * Cost Savings :
    * Cloud Computing is a cost saving technology. If you don't want to utilize all the 
resources of PCs then no need to purchase all the amount will be saved in your pocket. That cost can be used in other infrastructure developing.
  * Security :
