<br>Symbols like #,>,_ and many more are used to define a particular style or formatting. Html tags can also be used to insert list, tables, images etc.
<br>One example of this formatting is given below:
* __Syntax:-__ 
<br>| Syntax      | Description |
<br>  | ----------- | ----------- |
<br>  | Header      | Title       |
<br>  | Paragraph   | Text        |
<br>

* __Result:-__
  | Syntax      | Description |

  | Paragraph   | Text        |






# _7. What do mean by centralised system?_
* Centralized systems are systems that use client/server architecture where one or more client nodes are directly connected to a central server. This is the most commonly used type of system in many organisations where client sends a request to a company server and receives the response.

  * _Example:-_
    * Consider when we request a site to ahe web server, and it loads for us that site. Then we are Web client and server who is providing the data is working as a centralised system for a all the web clients.
