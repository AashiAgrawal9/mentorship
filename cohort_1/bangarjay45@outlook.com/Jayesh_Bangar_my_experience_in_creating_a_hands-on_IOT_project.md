### What is **Internet of Things**(Iot)?
- Internet of Things, is a system of internet connected computing devices, mechanical and digital machines or objects that have the ability to transfer data over a private network, resulting in reduced human efforts and a number of other advantages.
- Thanks to some brilliant minds, computer chips and wireless networks, we can turn anything(possibly) into a part of IoT.
- With Arduino, different sensors and motors, we can add some *digital intelligence* to dumb things, also enabling them to communicate, collect data or work for us without involving humans; the possibilities are endless.
- A intresting example of IoT device is **Amazon Echo** and many other smart speakers. It makes easier for people to play music, sounds amazing right!!
- Another example is Smart Home Lights. With a simple touch or Voice command, network connection, Smart led lights can be turned On/Off or their colour could be changed.
- IoT platform grants the user to control the IoT devices safely, whereever you are.

### Why is IoT so important?
- let's start with a simple example:
  - Say you're a manager in a big pharmaceutical industry and the responsibility of monitoring the **temp.** of a given drug rests on your shoulders.
  - The **Gov** has decided the threshold limit values of the drug, such that the **temp.** should not strictly exceed these limits, else your company might face a big loss.
  - A smart **Arduino and sensor** would make it easier for you to continuously monitor these temperatures as it would alert you by sending a pop-up messsage on your device if the temperature is about to exceed the set limits.
  - Also **Self-driving Cars, Smart cities..** just to name a few.
- Many Organisations use different approach with the help of IoT to operate more efficiently, to improve, monitor or to change decision making.

### Benifits of having Iot devices around us!
- **Productivity improvement:** Monitoring and control of the different processes improves the different operations that increase productivity and efficiency
- **Predictive analysis:** IoTâ€™s new technologies make it possible to examine recurring patterns and predicts irregularities.
- **Rapid response:** The data makes it possible to monitor the systems in place, in real time and even remotely, giving the company a strategic advantage in monitoring market developments.
- **Reduction of human errors:** Artificial intelligence in IoT makes it possible to reduce human errors due to work load or repetitive tasks.
- **Saves time and money**
- **Enhances productivity**
- **Encourages new techniques and business modals**
- **IoT** is big and getting bigger, and the benifits are countless, depending on perticular implementation, improving efficiency wherever it is utilised.
