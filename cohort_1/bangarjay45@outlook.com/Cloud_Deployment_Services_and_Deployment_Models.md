> Cloud Deployment Services
 1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
 2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
 3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
 
- Any Virtual machine comprises of three things, i.e. infrastructure(the actual hardware), the platform( the operating system) which will work on the infrastructure and the software which will work on the hardware and the operating system
- A user has to sort his requirements according to these three categories.
- He has to figure what infrastructure he will need, what operating system and what softwares he'd require.
- Various cloud providers provide different services which are mentioned down.

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
- Infrastructure is the actual hardware of any machine.
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) only deals with the infrastructure that should be provided.
- Rest everything will be checked by the consumer.
- If someone opts for IaaS, he will be provided with the necessary Hardware specifications he demanded. 
- He has to then deploy the platfrom he'll need and also the software's he needs.
- It provides better flexibility as the hardware resources can be tailored according to your needs.
- This cloud computing service model is ideal for large organizations capable of building and managing their platforms(operating systems).
- [Amazon Web Servies](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) are some providers that provide good **IaaS** service.


## PaaS (Platform as a Service):
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a service that looks for the infrastructure and the platform that the consumer wants.
- Only thing that the consumer has to look for is the software he needs.
- The organisation has to deploy the softwares on the VM by themselves.
- One can Master the installation and development of software applications with the help of PaaS.
- There is no need to manage the platform or hardware.
- [Google app engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) (Google Cloud) and [Amazon Web Servies](https://aws.amazon.com/) are some providers that provide good **PaaS** service.
 
 
## SaaS (Software as a Service):
- Software as a Service (SaaS) is requires no installation of any softwares or deployment of any platforms. 
- Consumers are free from the infrastructure and software installation or software maintenance.
- Automatic updates of the softwares is a advantage.
- It makes easier for testing of new softwares.
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/in) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) are some providers that provide good **SaaS** service.

> # Cloud Computing Deployment Models.
- Cloud deployment models show how the cloud services are provided to users. 
- The four deployment models in Cloud Computing are Private, Public, Hybrid and Community Cloud.

# Public Cloud.

- The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the **general public**.
- It may be bought, managed, and operated by anyone or even a business organisation.
- Anyone with the right hardware configuration and resources can operate a public cloud.
- Just set up your servers and start renting out storage and processing power.

### Public Cloud – Pros
The main advantages of using a public cloud are:
1. Low price (sometimes even free)
2. Scalable
3. It is Location independent.
4. And, you would only pay for what you actually use.

### Public Cloud – Cons
1. Security concerns, that deal with sensitive data.

## Takeaway.
- The biggest public cloud service providers are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure etc.
- It‘s ideal for small and medium businesses, especially ones with fluctuating or growing demands.


# Private Cloud.

- Public Cloud had security concerns. This issue is solved in Private Cloud.
- Private Cloud is privately used by a single organization, and not open to the public.
- It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, or the employee's.
- Example, a large Health insurance company needs a lot of computing resources, for many different parts of the company.
  They need to store and access coustomer data which is sensitive, but public cloud won't provide good security over their data.
- It is a cloud used by a company itself – rather than its customers.

### Private Cloud – Pros
- Control over how a cloud is setup and run.
- Control over privacy and security practices.
- Control over the location of data.

### Private Cloud – Cons
- Much higher setup and maintenance costs.
- Less scalability.

## Takeaway.
The biggest disadvantage is the extra cost. Even at a big company, a private cloud is going to be much smaller than a public cloud. This means there will likely be shortage of backups of data in case of a disaster or attack. And, less room for scaling up in case of usage spikes.


# Community Cloud.

- Public clouds are open to everyone, and private clouds are private to a single organization.
- The cloud infrastructure is created for specific use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared problems or goals.
-  A community cloud could be built by one organization in an industry, and then rented out to others in the same industry with similar computing and security requirements.

### Community Cloud – Pros
Community cloud has many of the advantages of both public and private clouds. 
1. Cloud requirements and security that meet the needs of your industry.
2. More scalable than private cloud.
3. Cheaper than private cloud.

### Community Cloud – Cons
1. A community cloud doesn‘t exist for every community


# Hybrid Cloud

- Hybrid cloud is a cloud environment that is a mix of private cloud and public cloud services 
- Establishing a hybrid cloud requires the availability of A public infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform, and the construction of a private cloud, either on premises or through a hosted private cloud provider.

## Pros
1. Hybrid cloud computing enables an companies to deploy an on-premises private cloud to host sensitive or critical workloads, and use a third-party public cloud provider to host less-critical information.

## Cons
1. The construction and maintenance of the private cloud requires substantial expertise from local IT staff and cloud architects.
