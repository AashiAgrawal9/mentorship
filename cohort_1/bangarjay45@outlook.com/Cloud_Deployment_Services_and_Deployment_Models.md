> Cloud Deployment Services
 1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
 2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
 3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
 
- Any Virtual machine comprises of three things, i.e. infrastructure(the actual hardware), the platform( the operating system) which will work on the infrastructure and the software which will work on the hardware and the operating system
- A user has to sort his requirements according to these three categories.
- He has to figure what infrastructure he will need, what operating system and what softwares he'd require.
- Various cloud providers provide different services which are mentioned down.

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
- Infrastructure is the actual hardware of any machine.
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) only deals with the infrastructure that should be provided.
- Rest everything will be checked by the consumer.
- If someone opts for IaaS, he will be provided with the necessary Hardware specifications he demanded. 
- He has to then deploy the platfrom he'll need and also the software's he needs.
- It provides better flexibility as the hardware resources can be tailored according to your needs.
- This cloud computing service model is ideal for large organizations capable of building and managing their platforms(operating systems).
- [Amazon Web Servies](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) are some providers that provide good **IaaS** service.

### IaaS is commonly used in the following scenarios:

Migrating workloads. Typically, IaaS facilities are managed in a similar way as on-premises infrastructure and provide an easy migration path for moving existing applications to the cloud.

Test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and development environments, bringing new applications to market faster. IaaS makes scaling development and testing environments, fast and economical.

Storage, backup, and recovery. Organizations avoid the capital outlay and complexity of storage management, which typically requires skilled staff to manage data and meet legal and compliance requirements. IaaS is useful for managing unpredictable demand and steadily growing storage needs. IaaS can also simplify the planning and management of backup and recovery systems.

----
## PaaS (Platform as a Service):
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a service that looks for the infrastructure and the platform that the consumer wants.
- Only thing that the consumer has to look for is the software he needs.
- The organisation has to deploy the softwares on the VM by themselves.
- One can Master the installation and development of software applications with the help of PaaS.
- There is no need to manage the platform or hardware.
- [Google app engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) (Google Cloud) and [Amazon Web Servies](https://aws.amazon.com/) are some providers that provide good **PaaS** service.

### PaaS is commonly used in the following scenarios:

Development framework. PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Just like Microsoft Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.

Analytics or business intelligence. Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data. They can find insights and patterns, and predict outcomes to improve business decisions such as forecasting, product design, and investment returns.

----
## SaaS (Software as a Service):
- Software as a Service (SaaS) is requires no installation of any softwares or deployment of any platforms. 
- Consumers are free from the infrastructure and software installation or software maintenance.
- Automatic updates of the softwares is a advantage.
- It makes easier for testing of new softwares.
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/in) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) are some providers that provide good **SaaS** service.

SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.

> # Cloud Computing Deployment Models.
- Cloud deployment models show how the cloud services are provided to users. 
- The four deployment models in Cloud Computing are Private, Public, Hybrid and Community Cloud.

# Public Cloud.

- The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the **general public**.
- It may be bought, managed, and operated by anyone or even a business organisation.
- Anyone with the right hardware configuration and resources can operate a public cloud.
- Just set up your servers and start renting out storage and processing power.

### Public Cloud – Pros
The main advantages of using a public cloud are:
1. Low price (sometimes even free)
2. Scalable
3. It is Location independent.
4. And, you would only pay for what you actually use.

### Public Cloud – Cons
1. Security concerns, that deal with sensitive data.

## Takeaway.
- The biggest public cloud service providers are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure etc.
- It‘s ideal for small and medium businesses, especially ones with fluctuating or growing demands.


# Private Cloud.

- Public Cloud had security concerns. This issue is solved in Private Cloud.
- Private Cloud is privately used by a single organization, and not open to the public.
- It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, or the employee's.
- Example, a large Health insurance company needs a lot of computing resources, for many different parts of the company.
  They need to store and access coustomer data which is sensitive, but public cloud won't provide good security over their data.
- It is a cloud used by a company itself – rather than its customers.

### Private Cloud – Pros
- Control over how a cloud is setup and run.
- Control over privacy and security practices.
- Control over the location of data.

### Private Cloud – Cons
- Much higher setup and maintenance costs.
- Less scalability.

## Takeaway.
The biggest disadvantage is the extra cost. Even at a big company, a private cloud is going to be much smaller than a public cloud. This means there will likely be shortage of backups of data in case of a disaster or attack. And, less room for scaling up in case of usage spikes.


# Community Cloud.

- Public clouds are open to everyone, and private clouds are private to a single organization.
- The cloud infrastructure is created for specific use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared problems or goals.
-  A community cloud could be built by one organization in an industry, and then rented out to others in the same industry with similar computing and security requirements.

### Community Cloud – Pros
Community cloud has many of the advantages of both public and private clouds. 
1. Cloud requirements and security that meet the needs of your industry.
2. More scalable than private cloud.
3. Cheaper than private cloud.

### Community Cloud – Cons
1. A community cloud doesn‘t exist for every community


# Hybrid Cloud

- Hybrid cloud is a cloud environment that is a mix of private cloud and public cloud services 
- Establishing a hybrid cloud requires the availability of A public infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform, and the construction of a private cloud, either on premises or through a hosted private cloud provider.

## Pros
1. Hybrid cloud computing enables an companies to deploy an on-premises private cloud to host sensitive or critical workloads, and use a third-party public cloud provider to host less-critical information.

## Cons
1. The construction and maintenance of the private cloud requires substantial expertise from local IT staff and cloud architects.

> # ***AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud***

### Introduction.
The 'Big Three' Public Cloud Vendors - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform continue to rule carefully when it comes to the adoption of Cloud Services.

It is a market that has been dominated by AWS since day one, when it entered the sector in 2006. Despite AWS’s dominance, Microsoft has gained ground under the leadership of "Cloud first" CEO Satya Nadella, building a huge global cloud network of its own.
Then there is the Internet giant Google, which has been busy with its Public Cloud Services and IaaS business under the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).


## AWS
![aws_logo-300x118](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/84272958-ba04e000-ab4b-11ea-9830-c2ab055efe93.png)

AWS was the first to offer public IaaS, as far back as 2006. Since they’ve been doing this the longest, it isn't be surprising that one of Amazon’s important strengths is the maturity of its IaaS offerings and the entire AWS ecosystem for that matter. 

AWS has an almost-overwhelming amount of different services available, with more than 175 across compute, storage, database, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications, and many more. The key strength for the market leader continues to be the depth of its services.

When the economic benifits for the customers are concerned, AWS has done a good job, but sometimes AWS can aslo extract heavy pricing for certain services.

Additionally,  AWS has the most data centers of any IaaS provider, which means they have the most comprehensive global coverage and the most robust, reliable network. These three key strengths are often the main draw to AWS for many customers.

Here are a few more pros of Amazon Web Services:
- Highly flexible
- Instant scalability
- Rapid deployment
- Focus on security (AWS shared responsibility model)
- User-friendly support


## Microsoft Azure
![Microsoft_Azure_Logo_svg-300x36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/84272963-bbcea380-ab4b-11ea-92be-2da668a31af4.png)

Microsoft on the other hand tends to be a popular choice because users can consume a great amount of their enterprise computing needs all in one place, from productivity and enterprise software and also the flexible cloud computing resources for their developers, with ease.

Their popularity is also due to the significant discounts and credits Microsoft offers on Azure to its existing customers, but even if it is those discounts that initially draw many customers in, the majority of Azure users report being happy with the service and usually stick with it.

Unlike AWS, Azure has a unique focus on hybrid cloud setups (a mixture of private on-premises and public off-premises cloud services). Hence Azure has become the go-to choice for large companies that require true hybrid cloud setups.

Azure is an also a great choice for companies that utilize lots of other Microsoft Services (like SQL, Active Directory, and .NET). . Azure’s customer satisfaction have actually led some analysts to predict that it will be the largest IaaS provider by 2019.
 
Here are a few more pros of Azure: 
- Highly scalable & secure
- High operational performance
- Lots of cost-efficient options for businesses
- Focus on Iaas and PaaS
- Strong hybrid options


# Google Cloud
![cloud logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65165798/84272953-b8d3b300-ab4b-11ea-93ad-d366ba3f17e4.png)

 Google is relatively new to the cloud game compared to AWS and Microsoft Azure, but they wasted no time proving themselves as a viable IaaS competitor and have secured a surprising number of large customers in just a few years.
- Google’s Cloud business is growing rapidly, too, with 12 new data centers planned in the next 18 months.
 
 Google is known for the intuitive simplicity of many of its products, and its Google Cloud management interface is no exception, with most users saying it is the easiest to use interface out of the three major IaaS vendors. Google offers a one-stop-shop AI platform, which helps machine learning engineers build and deploy models based on its popular open source TensorFlow deep learning library. Unsurprisingly, Google Cloud is uniquely well-suited to big data analytics and machine-learning applications, as Google has had years of expertise in those sectors and they enable their users to easily leverage that expertise from within Google Cloud.
 
- Google's scalable Compute Engine delivers VMs in Google's data centres.
- They are quick to boot, come with persistent disk storage, promise consistent performance and are highly customisable depending on the needs of the customer.

Google then made its own push into hybrid in 2019 with the release of Anthos, which is effectively a rebranding of the Google Cloud Services platform and brings together a combination of the existing Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), GKE On-Prem and the Anthos Config Management console. This promises unified administration, policies and security across hybrid Kubernetes deployments.

- That simplicity carries over to its pricing models too, where discounts are automatically applied based on utilization throughout the month.
- Lastly, Google’s auto load-balancing and auto-scaling features outperform the competition significantly, able to process upwards of 1 million requests per second without the pre-warming required on other platforms.
