 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
 
- Any Virtual machine comprises of three things, i.e. infrastructure(the actual hardware), the platform( the operating system) which will work on the infrastructure and the software which will work on the hardware and the operating system
- A user has to sort his requirements according to these three categories.
- He has to figure what infrastructure he will need, what operating system and what softwares he'd require.
- Various cloud providers provide different services which are mentioned down.

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
- Infrastructure is the actual hardware of any machine.
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) only deals with the infrastructure that should be provided.
- Rest everything will be checked by the consumer.
- If someone opts for IaaS, he will be provided with the necessary Hardware specifications he demanded. 
- He has to then deploy the platfrom he'll need and also the software's he needs.
- It provides better flexibility as the hardware resources can be tailored according to your needs.
- This cloud computing service model is ideal for large organizations capable of building and managing their platforms(operating systems).

## PaaS (Platform as a Service):
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a service that looks for the infrastructure and the platform that the consumer wants.
- Only thing that the consumer has to look for is the software he needs.
- The organisation has to deploy the softwares on the VM by themselves.
- One can Master the installation and development of software applications with the help of PaaS.
- There is no need to manage the platform or hardware.

## SaaS (Software as a Service):
- Software as a Service (SaaS) is requires no installation of any softwares or deployment of any platforms. 
- Consumers are free from the infrastructure and software installation or software maintenance.
- Automatic updates of the softwares is a advantage.
- It makes easier for testing of new softwares.
