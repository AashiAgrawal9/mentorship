# What is *Cloud Computing*? Why is it essential?
- #### Cloud Computing allows users to use applications without installation, hence increasing the computing efficiency and processing speed.
- #### It is done by centralizing data storage, the processing and bandwidth.
- #### Disaster recovery and data security are amongst the most important benifits. Also the maintenance cost is reduced.

# What is *Scalability* in Cloud Computing?
- #### In Cloud computing, you can add or substract resources for your machine, including memory or storage, as per requirement.
- #### It provides flexibility that saves time and money.
- #### When Demand increases, its easy to scale up to accomodate the new load.
- #### When Demand goes down, we can scale down accordingly.
- #### Without making expensive changes to your setup, we can support business growth.

# What is a Markdown Language?
- #### We all know HTML is a Markup language but there is a Markdown language.
- #### It is used to style the text of the documents, formatting etc.
- #### We can control the format of words(Bold or Italic), adding images and a few more things.

# What is *GitHub*? Why should i use it?
- #### Github provides a platform for the developer community to find, share, collaborate together on multiple projects.
- #### It grants various features, thus simplifying the process of working in a team.
- #### Members can work on files/projects and easily merge their changes in the master branch of the project.
