### What is *Cloud Computing*? Why is it essential?
- Cloud Computing allows users to use applications without installation, hence increasing the computing efficiency and processing speed.
- It is done by centralizing data storage, the processing and bandwidth.
- Disaster recovery and data security are amongst the most important benifits. Also the maintenance cost is reduced.

### What is *Scalability* in Cloud Computing?
- In Cloud computing, you can add or substract resources for your machine, including memory or storage, as per requirement.
- It provides flexibility that saves time and money.
- When Demand increases, its easy to scale up to accomodate the new load.
- When Demand goes down, we can scale down accordingly.
- Without making expensive changes to your setup, we can support business growth.

### What is a Markdown Language?
- We all know HTML is a Markup language but there is a Markdown language.
- It is used to style the text of the documents, formatting etc.
- We can control the format of words(Bold or Italic), adding images and a few more things.

### What is *GitHub*? Why should i use it?
- Github provides a platform for the developer community to find, share, collaborate together on multiple projects.
- It grants various features, thus simplifying the process of working in a team.
- Members can work on files/projects and easily merge their changes in the master branch of the project.

> # Features of **Github**
 1. Repository.
 2. Star.
 3. Watch.
 4. Forking.
 5. Pull request and Merge.
 
 ### Repositories:
- A repository is like a folder for your project.
- Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's history. 
- You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. 

 ### Forking:
 - Forking is copying a repository from one user’s account to another. 
 - This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. 

 ### Star:
 - People can star other repositories as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repo later.
 
 ### Watch:
 - You can watch a repository to receive notifications for new pull requests and changes that are created.
 
 ### Pull request and Merge:
 - If you want to make any changes, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner of the repository.
 - That user can then, merge the changes in the original repository.

 > Today I learned:-
  1. Disaster recovery in Cloud Computing.
  2. Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx).
  
### Disaster recovery in Cloud Computing
 
 - Data is the most valuable asset. Its loss can result in massive damage to your business, even the loss of reputation.
 - It is hard to predict when a disaster will occur and how serious its impact will be.
 - Cloud disaster recovery stores the system data on a remote cloud-based platform.
 - With disaster recovery in cloud computing, you get access to cloud storage, which can be used as a secondary recovery site.
 - You can always have a backup copy, even if one of the cloud data centers fails.
 - State-of-the-art network infrastructure of the cloud provider ensures that there are'nt any issues or errors. 

> ### Capital Expenditure(CapEx) and Operational Expenditure(OpEx)

 - **Understanding CapEx:**
 1. Capital expenditures are Equipments or services that are bought to improve or support a company's performance in the future.
    example: A Production house buys Camera's, photostudios, shooting equipments. This becomes the capital expenditure spent by the Production house.
 2. The expenses made should profit the company in the future. 
 3. The expenses become fixed assests and the value depreciates with time.
 4. There's only little guarantee that the investment activities brings sucess to the company in its useful life period.
 5. Capital expenditures (CAPEX) are a company's major, long-term investments.
  
  
 - **Understanding OpEx:**
 1. Operating expenses are the costs a company incurs for running their day-to-day operations.
 2. These are examples of operating expenses: Rent and utilities.
 3. The goal of any company is to maximize profits in near future as compared to CapEx.
 4. If the company is unsure of it's future, it won't risk a hefty amount of debt upon itself and the company will choose to rent a piece of equipment instead of purchasing .
 
 ### CLOUD COMPUTING – CAPEX VS. OPEX
 - Cloud service providers allows companies to use a “pay as they go” or OpEx model, which allows companies to use the Virtual Machines as per their requirement and the security of cloud.
 - There is potential cost benefits throughout the year.
 - Rather than just buying the complete hardware and paying for the network, the consumers would have the right resources in the form of **virtual machines** at the right time, without overspending.
 
 
 > # Cloud Storage:
- Cloud services have become the most suitable option for storing data online digitally.
- In the earlier times, most of the companies used to depend on their private servers for storing their growing collection of data and online files; but today storing data online on cloud servers is the next big thing as it allows unlimited storage. 
- The best thing about storing all the data in the cloud is that it ensures affordability and the data can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world.

##  Benefits of online data storage in the cloud:
 
 
### Usability And Accessibility
- Users can easily upload the files in the cloud storage.
- It is easy to save all the files and data in the cloud, no technical knowledge is required for this purpose.
- The stored files can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world with just a few clicks and an internet connection. 

### Disaster Recovery
- It is recommended for every business to have a backup plan in case of any emergency. 
- After all, losing important business data can cause huge losses to any business.
- Cloud storage is the perfect backup plan for businesses. It creates a backup of the files stored.
- These files are stored at a remote location and they can be retrieved and accessed at any time.

### Security
- Business owners can be sure that once the data is stored in the cloud, it is safe. 
- The best thing about using cloud storage is that server data is distributed across many servers and the data stored in the cloud is protected against any type of hardware failure. 
- Cloud servers also provide automated backups in order to make sure that your data is safe.

### Cost Savings
- Businesses and organizations can reduce annual operating costs by utilizing cloud storage. 
- Affordability can be ensured if data is stored online in the cloud. 
- Users can ensure additional cost savings because internal power and resources are not required separately for storing the data.

### Easy Sharing
- Data stored in cloud storage can be easily shared with clients and colleagues in an easy and secure way.
 
### Automation
- With cloud storage technology, the tedious task of data backups is simplified through automation. 
- You simply have to select what you want to backup and when you want to backup and your cloud environment will take care of the rest.
 
### Collaboration
- A cloud environment enables multiple people to access, edit and collaborate on a single file or document.
- People can access the cloud environment from anywhere in the world and collaborate in real-time. 
 
### Scalable Service
- Cloud hosting makes sure that you only pay for the resources that you actually use. 
- You can scale your cloud hosting environment whenever required and you can also define the attributes of scaling the cloud.
- This ensures more flexibility and a large storage space. 
 
### Convenience
- Even if you store data on transportable devices like external hard drives or flash drives, some kind of manual intervention and physical handling is required. 
- The data that is stored in a cloud is backed up online and it can be accessed from anywhere.

#### Hence, Online cloud storage and backup is beneficial for all types of businesses.
