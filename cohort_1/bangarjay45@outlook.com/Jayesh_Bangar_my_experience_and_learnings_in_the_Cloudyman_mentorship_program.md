### What is *Cloud Computing*? Why is it essential?
- Cloud Computing allows users to use applications without installation, hence increasing the computing efficiency and processing speed.
- It is done by centralizing data storage, the processing and bandwidth.
- Disaster recovery and data security are amongst the most important benifits. Also the maintenance cost is reduced.

### What is *Scalability* in Cloud Computing?
- In Cloud computing, you can add or substract resources for your machine, including memory or storage, as per requirement.
- It provides flexibility that saves time and money.
- When Demand increases, its easy to scale up to accomodate the new load.
- When Demand goes down, we can scale down accordingly.
- Without making expensive changes to your setup, we can support business growth.

### What is a Markdown Language?
- We all know HTML is a Markup language but there is a Markdown language.
- It is used to style the text of the documents, formatting etc.
- We can control the format of words(Bold or Italic), adding images and a few more things.

### What is *GitHub*? Why should i use it?
- Github provides a platform for the developer community to find, share, collaborate together on multiple projects.
- It grants various features, thus simplifying the process of working in a team.
- Members can work on files/projects and easily merge their changes in the master branch of the project.

> Features of **Github**
 1. Repository.
 2. Star.
 3. Watch.
 4. Forking.
 5. Pull request and Merge.
 
 ### Repositories:
- A repository is like a folder for your project.
- Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's history. 
- You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. 

 ### Forking:
 - Forking is copying a repository from one user’s account to another. 
 - This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. 

 ### Star:
 - People can star other repositories as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repo later.
 
 ### Watch:
 - You can watch a repository to receive notifications for new pull requests and changes that are created.
 
 ### Pull request and Merge:
 - If you want to make any changes, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner of the repository.
 - That user can then, merge the changes in the original repository.
