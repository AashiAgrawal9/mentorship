# Cost saving : 
Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of managing and maintaining your IT systems.
Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business, you can reduce your costs by using the resources of your cloud computing service provider.
 ## Examples :
 
 - ## No new equipment is necessary

You do not have to pay for new devices to accommodate your cloud computing services. The programs are designed to be accessed from many different devices that run various operating systems, such as Mac and Windows.

 - ##  Don't  need specialized tech teams.

Think about the cost of a specialized tech team. Wouldn’t it be easier to hand over the tedious operations to a professional team, without the professional team price? When you hire your own tech team, you have to pay training, salaries, and downtime. Cloud computing services provide the same service for less.

# Security :

In the ever-increasing era of data breaches, a top cloud computing security solution has security protocols in place to protect sensitive information and transactions. This prevents a third party from eavesdropping or tampering with data being transmitted

 ## Examples :
 - ## Data Encription :
Robust data encryptions within cloud-based security systems have substantially reduced the possibilities of data breaches, these solutions offer a layered approach that consists of security intelligence, key management, and secure access controls.

- ## Secure Storage : 
Traditional storage solutions don’t provide any protection against possible disasters that have the potential to erase required data from devices. Cloud computing allows the users to store their data safely, thereby negating any mishaps that may affect the equipment.

# Flexibility:
Cloud computing allows your employees to be more flexible – both in and out of the workplace. Employees can access files using web-enabled devices such as smartphones, laptops and notebooks. The ability to simultaneously share documents and other files over the Internet can also help support both internal and external collaboration. Many employers are now implementing “bring your own device (BYOD)” policies. In this way, cloud computing enables the use of mobile technology.

# Mobility :
Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers.
