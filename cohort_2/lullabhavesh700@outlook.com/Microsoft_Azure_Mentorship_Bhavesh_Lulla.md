# Microsoft Azure

 - Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.
 
 - Microsoft charges for Azure on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources they have used.
 
## Working of Microsoft Azure

 - Once customers subscribe to Azure, they have access to all the services included in the Azure portal. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as Virtual Machines (VM) and Databases.
 
 - In addition to the services that Microsoft offers through the Azure portal, a number of third-party vendors also make software directly available through Azure. The cost billed for third-party applications varies widely but may involve paying a subscription fee for the application, plus a usage fee for the infrastructure used to host the application.
 
 ## Microsoft Azure Products and Services
 
 ### Compute:
 
   These services enable a user to deploy and manage VMs, containers and batch jobs, as well as support remote application access. Compute resources created within the Azure cloud can be configured with either public IP addresses or private IP addresses, depending on whether the resource needs to be accessible to the outside world.
   
 ### Mobile:
 
   These products help developers build cloud applications for mobile devices, providing notification services, support for back-end tasks, tools for building application program interfaces (APIs) and the ability to couple geospatial context with data.
   
 ### Web:
 
   These services support the development and deployment of web applications. They also offer features for search, content  delivery, API management, notifications and reporting.
    
 ### Storage:
 
   This category of services provides scalable cloud storage for structured and unstructured data. It also supports big data projects, persistent storage and archival storage.
   
 ### Analytics:
 
   Thsese services provide distributed analytics and storage, as well as features of real-time analytics, big data analytics, data lakes, machine learning (ML), business intelligence (BI), Internet of Things (IOT) data streams and data warehousing.
   
 ### Networking:
 
   This group includes virtual networks, dedicated connections and gateways, as well as services for traffic management and diagnostics, load balancing, DNS hosting and network protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
 
 ### Media and Content Delivery Network (CDN):

   These CDN services include on-demand streaming, digital rights protection, encoding and media playback and indexing. 

 ### Integration:

   These are services for server backup, site recovery and connecting private and public clouds. 

 ### Internet of Things:

   These services help users capture monitor and analyze IoT data from sensors and other devices. Services include notifications, analytics, monitoring and support for coding and execution. 

 ### Security:

   These products provide capabilities to identify and respond to cloud security threats, as well as manage encryption keys and other sensitive assets. 

 ### Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning:

   This is a wide range of services that a developer can use to infuse artificial intelligence, machine learning and cognitive computing capabilities into applications and data sets. 

 ### Databases:

   This category includes Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offerings for SQL and NoSQL, as well as other database instances -- such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. 

 ### Management and Governance:

   These services provide a range of backup, recovery, compliance, automation, scheduling and monitoring tools that can help a cloud administrator manage an Azure deployment.
