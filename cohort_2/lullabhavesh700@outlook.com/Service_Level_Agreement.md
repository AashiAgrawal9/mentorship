## Service-Level Agreement

 - A service-level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and its customers that documents what services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet. 

 - A service-level commitment (SLC) is a broader and more generalized form of an SLA. The two differ because an SLA is bidirectional and involves two teams. In contrast, an SLC is a single-directional obligation that establishes what a team can guarantee its customers at any given time. 

## Why are SLAs important? 

 - Service providers need SLAs to help them manage customer expectations and define the severity levels and circumstances under which they are not liable for outages or performance issues. Customers can also benefit from SLAs because the contract describes the performance characteristics of the service, which can be compared with other vendors' SLAs and sets forth the means for redressing service issues. 
 
 - The SLA is typically one of two foundational agreements that service providers have with their customers. Many service providers establish a master service agreement to establish the general terms and conditions in which they will work with customers. The SLA is often incorporated by reference in the service provider's master service agreement. Between the two service contracts, the SLA adds greater specificity regarding the services provided and the metrics that will be used to measure their performance. 

 - When IT **outsourcing** emerged in the late 1980s, SLAs evolved as a mechanism to govern such relationships. Service-level agreements set the expectations for a service provider's performance and established penalties for missing the targets and, in some cases, bonuses for exceeding them. Since outsourcing projects were frequently customized for a particular customer, outsourcing SLAs were often drafted to govern a specific project. 

 - As managed services and **cloud computing** services become morw prevalent, SLAs evolve to address the new approaches. Shared services, rather than customized resources, characterized the newer contracting methods, so service-level commitments are frequently used to produce broad agreements that are intended to cover all of a service provider's customers.
