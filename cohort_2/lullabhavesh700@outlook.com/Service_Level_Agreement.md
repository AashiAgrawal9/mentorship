## Service-Level Agreement

 - A service-level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and its customers that documents what services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet. 

 - A service-level commitment (SLC) is a broader and more generalized form of an SLA. The two differ because an SLA is bidirectional and involves two teams. In contrast, an SLC is a single-directional obligation that establishes what a team can guarantee its customers at any given time. 

## Why are SLAs important? 

 - Service providers need SLAs to help them manage customer expectations and define the severity levels and circumstances under which they are not liable for outages or performance issues. Customers can also benefit from SLAs because the contract describes the performance characteristics of the service, which can be compared with other vendors' SLAs and sets forth the means for redressing service issues. 
 
 - The SLA is typically one of two foundational agreements that service providers have with their customers. Many service providers establish a master service agreement to establish the general terms and conditions in which they will work with customers. The SLA is often incorporated by reference in the service provider's master service agreement. Between the two service contracts, the SLA adds greater specificity regarding the services provided and the metrics that will be used to measure their performance. 

 - When IT **outsourcing** emerged in the late 1980s, SLAs evolved as a mechanism to govern such relationships. Service-level agreements set the expectations for a service provider's performance and established penalties for missing the targets and, in some cases, bonuses for exceeding them. Since outsourcing projects were frequently customized for a particular customer, outsourcing SLAs were often drafted to govern a specific project. 

 - As managed services and **cloud computing** services become morw prevalent, SLAs evolve to address the new approaches. Shared services, rather than customized resources, characterized the newer contracting methods, so service-level commitments are frequently used to produce broad agreements that are intended to cover all of a service provider's customers. 

## Who needs a service-level agreement? 

 - SLAs are thought to have originated with network service providers but are now widely used in a range of IT related fields. Some examples of industries that establish SLAs include IT service providers and managed service providers, as well as cloud computing and internet service providers. 

 - Corporate IT organizations, particularly those who have embraced **IT service management**, enter SLAs with their in-house customers -- users in other departments within the enterprise. An IT department creates an SLA so that it's services can be measured, justified and perhaps compared with those of outscoring vendors. 

 - In broad terms, an SLA will typically include a statement of objectives, a list of the services to be covered by the agreement and a definition of the responsibilities and customer under the SLA. 

 - The customer, for example, will be responsible for making a representative available to resolve issues with the service provider in connection with the SLA. The service provider will be responsible for meeting the level of service as defined by the SLA. The service provider's performance is judged according to a set of **metrics**. Response time and resolution time are among the key metrics included in an SLA, since they relate to how the service provider deals with a service interruption. 

## Key components of an SLA

   Key components of a service-level agreement include:

   **Agreement overview** -- This first section sets forth the basics of the agreement, including the parties involved, the start date and a general introduction of the services provided. 

   **Description of services** -- The SLA needs detailed descriptions of every service offered, under all possible circumstances, with the turnaround times included. Service definitions should include how the services are delivered, whether maintenance service is offered, what the hours of operation are, where dependencies exist, and outline of the processes and a list of all technology and applications used. 

   **Exclusions** -- Specific services that are not offered should also be clearly defined to avoid confusion and eliminate room for assumptions from other parties. 

   **Service performance** -- Performance measurements metrics and performance levels are defined. The client and service provider should agree on a list of all the metrics they will used to measure the **service levels** of the provider. 

   **Redressing** -- Compensation or payment should be defined in the event that a provider cannot properly fulfill their SLA. 

   **Stakeholders** -- Clearly defines the parties involved in the agreement and establish their responsibility. 

   **Security** -- All security measures that will be taken by the service providers are defined. Typically, this includes the drafting and consensus on antipoaching, IT security and nondisclosure agreements. 

   **Risk management and disaster recovery** -- Risk management processes and a **disaster recovery plan** are established and clearly communicated. 

   **Service tracking and reporting** -- This section defines the reporting structure, tracking intervals and **stakeholders** involved in a agreement. 

   **Periodic review and change processes** -- The SLA and all established key performance indicators (KPIs) should be regularly reviewed. This process is defined as well as the appropriate process for making changes. 

   **Termination process** -- The SLA should define the circumstances under which the agreement can be terminated or will expire. The notice period from either side should also be established. 

   **Signatures** -- Finally, all stakeholders and authorized participants from both parties must sign the document to show their approval of every detail and process.
