## what is cloud computing ?
  The technology of distributed dada processing  in which some scalable information resources and capabilities are provided as a service to multiple external  customers through internet  technology 
  Information and data  is stored  on physics or virtual  servers which are maintained and controlled by a cloud computing provider such as Amazon and their AWS provider 

## Benefits of cloud computing:-
  1. cost saving is the biggest  benefit of cloud computing 
  2. High speed 
  3. unlimited storage capacity 
  4. Automatic software integration
  5. Improved  compatibility between operating systems 
  6. collaboration  efficiency 
  7. Increase  scalability  and Reliability and many more...
  
## Applications of cloud computing 
  Clients would be able to access their applications and data from anywhere at any time They could access the cloud computing system using any computer linked to the internet 

## Example of cloud computing 
   Cloud computing  is a use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network 
   An example of cloud computing provider is Google's Gmail Gmail user can access files and applications hosted by Google via the internet from any device 

# Main features/Benefits  of cloud computing 
 
## cost saving:
   An advantage of cloud computing is reduction in hardware cost. Along with purchase cost, off-site  hardware cuts internal power cost and saves space 
   You can save  substantial capital costs through reduction in spending on equipment, infrastructure and software 
   The contract with most cloud service providers includes the costs of system upgrades, new hardware and software 

## security:
   There are  best benefits of cloud computing 
   1. Data Encryption
   2. Avoid DDoS Attacks
   3. Regulatory compliance 
   4. secure storage 
   5. Patch management 
   6. Flexibility 
   7. High availability and support 

## Flexibility and scalability:
   Cloud computing allows your employees  to be more flexible  both in and out of the work place Employees  can access Files using web enabled devices such as smartphones  laptops and notebooks

## Mobility:
   The cloud  is the powerful mobility that cloud computing providers one of the benefits of cloud mobility is the ability to connect  better with the people It allows people to access mission- critical data  and software from anywhere anytime 

## Increased collaboration:
   Cloud computing is rapidly growing solution for issues related to data storage and collaboration 
   1. Improved organization,
   2. Higher participation levels 
   3. Improved access to large files 
   4. Real time updates 
   5. Better brainstorming 

## Disaster recovery 
   Data loss is a major concern for all organizations, along with data security If your  equipment like laptops or pc is damaged cloud based services provide quick data recovery for all kinds of emergency scenarios from natural disaster to power outages

## Automatic software updates:
   Access to automatic updates for It requirement, Depending on your cloud  computing service provider your system will be regularly be updated with latest technology 

# Types of cloud computing 
  Cloud computing  can be broken up into three main services 
  1. Software-as-a-service (SaaS)
  2. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (LaaS)
  3. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)
  These three services make up what Rackspace calls the cloud computing Stack , with SaaS on top,PaaS in the middle and LaaS on the bottom
