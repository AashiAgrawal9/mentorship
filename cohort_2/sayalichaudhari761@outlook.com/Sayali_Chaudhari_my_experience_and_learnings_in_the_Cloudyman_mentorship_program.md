# 1. Short preface of _Cloud Computing._

* Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. It goes back to the days of flowcharts and presentations that would represent the gigantic server's infrastructure of the Internet as nothing but a unstructured network accepting connections and giving out information as it floats. Cloud computing is a term used to describe the use of hardware and software delivered via network.



# 2. Why We _Need Cloud Computing?_

* We Learned this topic with the example like we have one application for our organization and we have to run it fluently without any lag so basically many Problems may occur without cloud computing scenario like we have not enough space and RAM to run that application without any lag...so here is the cloud computing thing comes into the picture now we will use cloud server or machine to run that software and run it virtually on cloud server*



# 3. What is the use of _learning cloud computing?_

- Learn cloud computing so that you will be able to store,manage,process,share,collaborate data and information with high speech and accuracy.

- Learn Cloud Computing so that you can use it to grow your business.

- Learn Cloud Computing because itâ€™s a latest technological change and we are the part of this change from local server computing to using the network of remote server.

- If you are a programmer and fresher in programming learn about cloud computing. It will help you to understand the new ways you can use to program,devlop,deploy and provide application access to the users.



# 4. _I am a programmer, I don't need to learn cloud computing?_

* Till now we learned many programming languages like c,c++, python but we just compile the code and run it thats it so our work finished but in industry level we need to deploy our code on cloud and we have think about time complexity , space complexity,etc because thousands of people are accessing code at same time thats why programmer also need to learn about Cloud Computing.



# 5. What is the _basic concept of GitHub?_


* GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. 
It connects the developers and coders from all over the world with each other to share knowledge and work together.




# 6. How we can _use GitHub_, and what are the _features of GitHub?_


* GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects. It allows you to share your code and edit in others code. You can use this essential features provided by GitHub and perform a lot of task.

  > ## Features of github 
  
   - #### Development teams everywhere can work together to secure the software supply chain
   - #### Github simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects
   - #### Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit and manage the code files.
     ## ***Repository***
     - #### A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded
     ## ***Fork***
     - #### forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
     ## ***Star***
     - #### Users on the GitHub website are able to ***star*** other people's repositories, thereby saving them in their list of Starred Repos. Some people use ***stars*** to indicate that they like a project, other people use them as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repo later.
     ## ***Watch***
     - #### When you are watching a project or a person you will receive status updates on their activities. These activities include commits, tagging, repository creation etc.




# 7. Importance of _technical documentation_.

* Documentation help ensure consent and expectations. Having reliable documentation is crucial in helping users figure out how to use a product as well as aiding writers and developers in creating work of consistent and high quality. Also if you are working on something currently and meanwhile you forget one or the other thing then you can always have a quick look at your documentation and recall evrything. Technical documentation is an asset for your organization, for the simple reason that it enables employees to access information without chasing their managers.



# 8. How to use _GitHub Repository_ and how to _pull request_ any information?

* _we can restrict who has access to a repository by choosing the repository's visibility_

  * Pool Request is it tells owner and others about you have did some changes or added some data in repository and owner has access to approve or disapprove the pool request.




# 9. What is _markdown language?_

* Markup Language is used for annotate text and embed tags.  
For e.g - HTML(Hyper Text Mark-up Language)Whuch is used for web designing.  

* Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like "#" or "*".

Symbols like #,>,_ and many more are used to define a particular style or formatting. Html tags can also be used to insert list, tables, images etc.
