#### TodayToday, cloud computing applications and platforms are rapidly growing across all industries, serving as the IT infrastructure that drives new digital businesses.
These platforms and applications have revolutionized the ways in which businesses function, and have made processes easier.
In fact, more than ****77 percent**** of businesses today have at least some portion of their computing infrastructure in the cloud.


#### While there are many cloud computing platforms available, two platforms dominate the cloud computing industry.
****Amazon Web Services (AWS)**** and Microsoft Azure are the two giants in the world of cloud computing.

####  While AWS is the largest cloud computing platform, Microsoft Azure is the fastest-growing and second-largest.
This article focuses on Microsoft Azure and what is Azure—its services and uses. But before we delve into Microsoft Azure, 
here’s a look at everything you’ll find in this article:

### What is cloud computing?
### Why is cloud computing important?
### What is Azure?
### What are the various Azure services?
### What are the various uses of Azure?

Before diving into what is Azure, you should first know what cloud computing is.

## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is a technology that provides access to various computing resources over the internet.
All you need to do is use your computer or mobile device to connect to your cloud service provider through the internet.
Once connected, you get access to computing resources, which may include serverless computing,
virtual machines, storage, and various other things.

- Basically, cloud service providers have massive data centers that contain hundreds of servers, storage systems and components that are crucial for many kinds of organizations. 
These data centers are in secure locations and store a large amount of data. 
The users connect to these data centers to collect data or use it when required. U
users can take advantage of various services; for example, if you want a notification every time someone sends you a text or an email, cloud services can help you. 
The best part about cloud platforms is that you pay only for the services you use, and there are no charges upfront.

- Cloud computing can be used for various purposes: machine learning, data analysis, storage and backup, streaming media content and so much more.
Here’s an interesting fact about the cloud: all the shows and movies that you see on Netflix are actually stored in the cloud.
Also, the cloud can be beneficial for creating and testing applications, automating software delivery, and hosting blogs.

- Azure is a cloud computing platform and an online portal that allows you to access and manage cloud services and resources provided by Microsoft.
These services and resources include storing your data and transforming it, depending on yo
ur requirements.
To get access to these resources and services, all you need to have is an active internet connection and the ability to connect to the Azure portal.

#### Things that you should know about Azure:

- It was launched on February 1, 2010, significantly later than its main competitor, AWS.

- It’s free to start and follows a pay-per-use model, which means you pay only for the services you opt for.

- Interestingly, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies use Azure services for their cloud computing needs.

- Azure supports multiple programming languages, ****including Java, Node Js, and C#****.

##### Another benefit of Azure is the number of data centers it has around the world. There are 42 Azure data centers spread around the globe,
which is the highest number of data centers for any cloud platform. Also, Azure is planning to get 12 more data centers, which will increase the number of data centers to 54, shortly.
Let’s now discuss what are the various Microsoft Azure services in the what is Azure article.
