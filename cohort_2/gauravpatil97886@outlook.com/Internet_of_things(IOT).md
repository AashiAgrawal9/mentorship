# Introduction to Internet of things(IOT):

=================================================

![](https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/What-to-Expect-from-a-Modern-IoT-Platform-in-2019.jpg)

---------
##### (The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded 
##### computing devices within the existing Internet infrastructure)
-----------


- Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment.

- In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, 
and smart homes are just a very few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established

-  ****Over 9 billion**** ‘Things’ (physical objects) are currently connected to the Internet, 
as of now. In the near future, this number is expected to rise to a whopping 20 billion.

## There are four main components used in IoT:
------

 ****1.Low-power embedded systems****–

- Less battery consumption, high performance are the inverse factors play a significant role during the design of electronic systems.


****2.Cloud computing**** –

- Data collected through IoT devices is massive and this data has to be stored on a reliable storage server.
This is where cloud computing comes into play. The data is processed and learned, giving more room 
for us to discover where things like electrical faults/errors are within the system.

****3.Av**ailability of big data****–

- We know that IoT relies heavily on sensors, 
especially real-time. As these electronic devices spread throughout every field, their usage is going to trigger a massive flux of big data.

****4.Networking connection****–

- In order to communicate, interne
- In order to communicate, internet connectivity is a must where each physical object is 
represented by an IP address. However, there are only a limited number of addresses available according to the IP naming. Due to the growing number of devices, this naming system will not be feasible anymore. Therefore, researchers are looking for another alternative naming system to represent each physical object

## There are two ways of building IoT:
------

- Form a separate internetwork including only physical objects.

- Make the Internet ever more expansive, but this requires hard-core technologies such as rigorous cloud computing
and rapid **big data storage (expensive)**.

- In the near future, IoT will become broader and more complex in terms of scope. It will change the world in terms of

### 1.IoT Enablers –

**RFIDs:**** uses radio waves in order to electronically track the tags attached to each physical object.

****Sensors:**** devices that are able to detect changes in an environment (ex: motion detectors).

****Nanotechnology****: as the name suggests, these are extremely small devices with dimensions usually less than a hundred nanometers.

****Smart networks****: (ex: mesh topology).

----------

## Characteristics of IoT:


- Massively scalable and efficient

- 
- IP-based addressing will no longer be suitable in the upcoming future.

- An abundance of physical objects is present that does not use IP, so IoT is made possible.

- Devices typically consume less power. When not in use, they should be automatically programmed to sleep.

- A device that is connected to another device right now may not be connected in another instant of time.

- ****Intermittent connectivity**** – IoT devices aren’t always connected. In order to save bandwidth and battery consumption,
- devices will be powered off periodically when not in use. Otherwise, connections might turn unreliable and thus prove to be inefficient.

## Modern Applications:

#### Smart Grids

#### Smart cities

#### Smart homes

#### Healthcare

#### Earthquake detection

#### Radiation detection/hazardous gas detection

#### Smartphone detection

####  Water flow monitoring

# Why IoT Matters?


- ###When something is connected to the internet, that means that it can send information or receive information, or both. This ability to send and/or receive information makes things “smart."


- Let’s use ****smartphones**** again as an example. 

- Right now you can listen to just about any song in the world, but it’s not because your phone actually has every song in the world stored on it. It’s because every song in the world is stored somewhere else, but your phone can send information (asking for that song) and then receive information (streaming that song on your phone).

- To be smart, a thing doesn't need to have super storage or a super computer inside of it - it just needs access to it. All a thing has to do is connect to super storage or to a super computer. In the Internet of Things, all the things that are being connected to the internet can be put into three categories:

- Things that collect information and then send it.

- Things that receive information and then act on it.


- Things that do both.
And all ****three of these have enormous benefits that compound on each other****.

---------

#### 1. Collecting and Sending Information

- ****Sensors could be temperature sensors****, motion sensors, moisture sensors, air quality sensors, light sensors, you name it. These sensors, along with a connection, allow us to automatically collect information from the environment which, in turn, allows us to make more intelligent decisions.

- On a farm, automatically getting information about the soil moisture can tell farmers exactly when their crops need to be watered. Instead of watering too much (which can be an expensive over-use of irrigation systems) or watering too little (which can be an expensive loss of crops), the farmer can ensure that crops get exactly the right amount of water. This enables farmers to increase their crop yield while decreasing their associated expenses.

- Just as our sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste allow us, humans, to make sense of the world, sensors allow machines (and the humans monitoring the machines) to make sense of the world.

----------

#### 2. Receiving and Acting on Information

- We’re all very ****familiar with machines**** getting information and then acting. Your printer receives a document and it prints it. Your car receives a signal from your car keys and the doors open. The examples are endless.

- Whether it’s a simple as sending the command “turn on” or as complex as sending a 3D model to a 3D printer, we know that we can tell machines what to do from far away. So what?

- The real power of the Internet of Things arises when things can do both of the above. Things that collect information and send it, but also receive information and act on it.

-------------


#### 3. Doing Both: The Goal of an IoT System

- Let’s quickly go back to the farming example. The sensors can collect information about the soil moisture to tell the farmer how much to water the crops, but you don’t actually need the farmer. Instead, the irrigation system can automatically turn on as needed, based on how much moisture is in the soil.

- You can take it a step further too. If the irrigation system receives information about the weather from its internet connection, it can also know when it’s going to rain and decide not to water the crops today because they’ll be watered by the rain anyways.

- And it doesn’t stop there! All this information about the soil moisture, how much the irrigation system is watering the crops, and how well the crops actually grow can be collected and sent to supercomputers that run amazing algorithms that can make sense of all this information.

- And that’s just one kind of sensor. Add in other sensors like light, air quality, and temperature, and these algorithms can learn much, much more. With dozens, hundreds, thousands of farms all collecting this information, these algorithms can create incredible insights into how to make crops grow the best, helping to feed the world.

****And agriculture is just one of many applications of IoT…****
