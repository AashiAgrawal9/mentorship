 # Q.1.Cloud Computing allows users to use applications without installation, hence increasing the computing efficiency and processing speed.It is done by centralizing data storage, the processing and bandwidth.

+ Disaster recovery and data security are amongst the most important benifits. Also the maintenance cost is reduced.

+ It is done by centralizing data storage, the processing and bandwidth.

+ Cloud computing is not just a trendy application that people can use to store their photos and videos online. It is part of a business model that is taking the world by storm. Cloud computing not only changes how so many businesses store and access data, but it is also changing how many of these businesses operate.

+ Large businesses have an advantage when it comes to the cloud. They can work with the major cloud providers and get every service perk they need. But one of the great things about the cloud is that even small and medium-sized operations can benefit from it.

+ Cloud computing is so important because it offers flexibility, data recovery, little to no maintenance, easy access and a higher level of security.

# .Q2.What is Scalability in Cloud Computing?

+ Scalability in cloud computing is the ability to quickly and easily increase or decrease the size or power of an IT solution. A scalable cloud is why you can sign up and use most cloud solutions in just a few minutes – if not seconds. It’s why you can add.

< There are usually two ways to scale a cloud solution up or down:>
- 1.Contact the cloud provider to request it.
- 2.Add the resources yourself via an online portal.

+ **Three types of scalability – Vertical, Horizontal and Diagonal**

- Scale Vertically – Scale Up: ...
- Scale Horizontally – Scale out: ...
- Scale Diagonally: ...
- Scalable Cloud Based Services: ...

# Q.3.What is Markdown Language.

+ **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[9] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

+ Since the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, the implementations that appeared over the years have subtle differences and many come with syntax extensions.

+ **History of markdown language**
+ John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax,[2][3] with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".[4]

+ Its key design goal is readability – that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions,[10] unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions. To this end, its main inspiration is the existing conventions for marking up plain text in email, though it also draws from earlier markup languages, notably setext, Textile, and reStructuredText.[10]

+ Gruber wrote a Perl script, Markdown.pl, which converts marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML or HTML and replaces angle brackets '<' '>' and ampersands '&' with their corresponding character entity references. It can be used as a standalone script, as a plugin for Blosxom or Movable Type, or as a text filter for BBEdit.[4]

+ Markdown has since been re-implemented by others e.g. in a Perl module available on CPAN (Text::Markdown), and in a variety of other programming languages.[11] It is distributed under a BSD-style license and is included with, or available as a plugin for, several content-management systems.[7][12][13]

+ Sites like GitHub, Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, OpenStreetMap, and SourceForge use variants of Markdown to facilitate discussion between users.[14][15][16][17]

# Q.4 what is a github?

GitHub, Inc. is a United States-based global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. In 2018, it became a subsidiary of Microsoft for US$7.5 billion. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features. Wikipedia
