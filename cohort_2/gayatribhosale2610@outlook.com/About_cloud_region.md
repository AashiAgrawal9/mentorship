# What is a region?

The simplest explanation is that a “cloud region” describes the actual, real-life geographic location where your public cloud 
resources are located.It’s a common misconception that the “cloud” is just that—an intangible, ethereal storage space that 
exists only as a concept somewhere in the sky. But the cloud is just a prettier name for actual devices that process data. 
They’re data centers, and those data centers live in places.

## Why are regions important?

- Regions allow you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers, both internal or external. The closer your customers 
are to the region where your cloud resources are located, the faster and better their experience will be. For example, if your 
customers are located in Germany, it makes sense to choose a European region for your cloud region, even if your office is in 
Delaware.

- Regions are also commonly used as part of disaster recovery (DR) strategy. While many public cloud users depend on the
reliability and redundancy of inter-region resources for DR, some use multiple regions to achieve the same result. Sometimes 
this is required for regulatory or compliance reasons, but sometimes it’s simply company policy.
