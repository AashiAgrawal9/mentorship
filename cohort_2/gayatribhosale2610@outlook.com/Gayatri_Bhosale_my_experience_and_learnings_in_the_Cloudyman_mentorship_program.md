# About today's Session
Today I learned about cloud computing.

## What is Cloud Computing ? 

- Cloud computing is an architecture or a platform that permit use of other technologies that can store, retrieve, modify and distribute -the data from hosted servers rather than from individual systems.
- It allows several people to work on the same document in real time. People can save a great deal of time spent in updating, filling, and printing documents.
- It refers to  manipulating, configuring,  and  accessing  the hardware and software resources remotely.
- Cloud computing has become the ideal way to deliver enterprise applicationsâ€”and the preferred solution for companies extending their infrastructure or launching new innovations.

## Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has three most common types of cloud services to offer. Depending on the needs of users, any type of cloud computing service is used either individually or in combination with others. The following is a brief introduction to the three cloud service types, namely, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.

## Affect of Cloud on Human Lives

- The application became cheaper, easier to find, and use.

- The new application becomes more comfortable to develop & create based on a standard modular part.

- Cloud will provide new social services by connecting through social networks.

- Lessen the usage of proprietary operating systems in our daily computing.

- Connection to the cloud can be done whenever we want.

## About Virtual Machine

A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer.Virtual machines are implemented by software emulation methods or hardware virtualization techniques. A lightweight software known as hypervisor allocates the computing resources (RAM, CPU power, memory, storage, etc.) of the server or host to each VM, keeping all of them separate to avoid interference.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing 

### Cost Savings
Cost saving is the biggest benefit of cloud computing.The services are free from capital expenditure. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not need any physical hardware investments. 

### Security
Cloud computing offers great security when any sensitive data has been lost. As the data is stored in the system, it can be easily accessed even if something happens to your computer. You can even remotely wipe out data from the lost machines for avoiding it getting in the wrong hands.

### Flexibility
It offers flexible facility which could be turned off, up or down as per the circumstances of the user. For instance, a promotion of sales is very popular, capacity can be immediately and quickly added to it for the avoidance of losing sales and crashing servers. When those sales are done, the capacity can also be shrunk for the reduction of costs.

### Mobility
Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers.
