 ### **_About today's session_**

- Today I learn the basic syntax which are used in ***cloud computing***.

- cloud computing is the best platform for everyone.

- Our work is make easy using cloud computing.

- Using cloud platform  many compinees are growing up. 

- using cloud platoform a huge work is also done on any computer.

The speaker is explained in simple way about **cloud computing**

## What is a Virtual Machine?

> - In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

## How do Virtual machines work?
> - Virtualization technology allows you to share a system with many virtual environments. The hypervisor manages the hardware and separates the physical resources from the virtual environments. Resources are partitioned as needed from the physical environment to the VMs.

> - When the VM is running and a user or program issues an instruction that requires additional resources from the physical environment, the hypervisor schedules the request to the physical system’s resources so that the virtual machine’s operating system and applications can access the shared pool of physical resources.

## **Types of cloud services**

- **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**

> Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you the most control over the provided hardware that runs your application (IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.
 
 - **Platform as a service (PaaS)**
 
> PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates.
 
 - **Software as a service (SaaS)**
> SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are perfect examples of SaaS software.
 
 ## Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)
 
 - **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**
 
 > CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.
 
 - **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**
 
 > OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There's no upfront cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it.

# **_Benefits of cloud computing_**
## 1)Cost Savings

> - One of the most significant benefits of cloud computing is considerable savings in company’s IT cost. Businesses, no matter what their type or size, by moving to cloud computing you can save substantial capital costs through reduction in spending on equipment, infrastructure and software. It allows you to rent additional processing power over the Internet without having to use million-dollar machines as servers. Rather than spending big money on hardware, software or licensing and renewal fees you will cut down your both capital and operating costs by using the resources of your cloud service provider. The contract with most cloud service providers includes the costs of system upgrades, new hardware and software etc. Besides, by moving to cloud you avoid recruitment of IT staff and also save on your energy consumption for running your own data center. As the Cloud platform is utility based, you only pay to the service provider just for what you use when you need it. Thus, with a pay-as-you-go,subscription-based cost structure, cloud services require a lower initial investment and typically much lower overall costs than ‘on-premise’ models.

## 2)Security

> - Another major benefits of cloud computing is – strict adherence by the cloud service providers to a high-level security protocol to ensure data protection. Because cloud providers offer services to a large number of businesses and companies, they stick to high security standards to improve data security by following a layered approach that includes data encryption, key management, strong access controls, and security intelligence in addition to regular security audits. As the costs for implementing these security measures are shared across all users in cloud, it is easier for the service providers to allocate resources to provide improved information security that many individual customers cannot afford to.

## 3)Flexibility

> - Cloud computing offers more flexibility to your employees in their work practices. If you need access to your files and data while you are off-site or at home, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily whenever you need through any web-enable devices.It gives organizations the freedom to utilize their existing programming models, operating systems, databases, and architectures. It allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices.

## 4)Mobility

> - Cloud computing model gives your business the ability to communicate and share more easily outside of the traditional methods. It allows much greater collaboration between employees allowing multiple users to share and work on data and document at the same time. Cloud makes it easy for the company’s design and construction professionals, who spend much of their time on job sites overseas or across different locations, to access work related information, files and records quickly and in a secure way.
> - Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which, considering over 2.6 billion smartphones are being used globally today, is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up to date with clients and co-worker.Through the cloud, you can offer conveniently accessible information to sales staff who travel, freelance employees, or remote employees, for better work-life balance. Therefore, it's not surprising to see that organizations with employee satisfaction listed as a priority are up to 24% more likely to expand cloud usage.

## 5)Insight

> - As we move ever further into the digital age, it's becoming clearer and clearer that the old adage “knowledge is power” has taken on the more modern and accurate form: “Data is money.” Hidden within the millions of bits of data that surround your customer transactions and business process are nuggets of invaluable, actionable information just waiting to be identified and acted upon. Of course, sifting through that data to find these kernels can be very difficult, unless you have access to the right cloud-computing solution.
> - Many cloud-based storage solutions offer integrated cloud analytics for a bird's-eye view of your data. With your information stored in the cloud, you can easily implement tracking mechanisms and build customized reports to analyze information organization wide. From those insights, you can increase efficiencies and build action plans to meet organizational goals. For example, the beverage company Sunny Delight was able to increase profits by about $2 million a year and cut $195,000 in staffing costs through cloud-based business insights.

## 6)Increased Collaboration

> - If your business has two employees or more, then you should be making collaboration a top priority. After all, there isn't much point to having a team if it is unable to work like a team. Cloud computing makes collaboration a simple process. Team members can view and share information easily and securely across a cloud-based platform. Some cloud-based services even provide collaborative social spaces to connect employees across your organization, therefore increasing interest and engagement. Collaboration may be possible without a cloud-computing solution, but it will never be as easy, nor as effective.
