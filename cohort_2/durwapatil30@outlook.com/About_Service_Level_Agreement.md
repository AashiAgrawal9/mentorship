# What are Service-Level Agreements ?

##### Ans. 

- A service-level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user.

- The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract.

- The agreement may involve separate organizations, or different teams within one organization. Contracts between the service provider and other third parties are often (incorrectly) called SLAs – because the level of service has been set by the (principal) customer, there can be no "agreement" between third parties; these agreements are simply "contracts.

- SLAs commonly include many components, from a definition of services to the termination of agreement.

- SLAs are so widely used these days that larger organizations have many different SLAs existing within the company itself.

- Two different units in an organization script a SLA with one unit being the customer and another being the service provider.

- This practice helps to maintain the same quality of service amongst different units in the organization and also across multiple locations of the organization.

- This internal scripting of SLA also helps to compare the quality of service between an in-house department and an external service provider.

# Components of Service-Level Agreements :

A well defined and typical SLA will contain the following components

### 1.Type of service to be provided :
It specifies the type of service and any additional details of type of service to be provided.

### 2.The service's desired performance level, especially its reliability and responsiveness :
A reliable service will be the one which suffers minimum disruptions in a specific amount of time and is available at almost all times.

### 3.Monitoring process and service level reporting :
This component describes how the performance levels are supervised and monitored.

### 4.The steps for reporting issues with the service :
This component will specify the contact details to report the problem to and the order in which details about the issue have to be reported.

### 5.Response and issue resolution time-frame :
Response time-frame is the time period by which the service provider will start the investigation of the issue.

### 6.Repercussions for service provider not meeting its commitment :
If the provider is not able to meet the requirements as stated in SLA then service provider will have to face consequences for the same.

# Service Level Agreement Types :

Because service level agreements have many applications, they have been divided into categories. Thus, we have:

### 1.Customer-based SLA :
An agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use. For example, an SLA between a supplier (IT service provider) and the finance department of a large organization for the services such as finance system, payroll system, billing system, procurement/purchase system, etc.

### 2.Service-based SLA :

- An agreement for all customers using the services being delivered by the service provider. For example:

- A mobile service provider offers a routine service to all the customers and offers certain maintenance as a part of an offer with the universal charging.

- An email system for the entire organization. There are chances of difficulties arising in this type of SLA as level of the services being offered may vary for different customers (for example, head office staff may use high-speed LAN connections while local offices may have to use a lower speed leased line).

### 3.Multilevel SLA :

- The SLA is split into the different levels, each addressing different set of customers for the same services, in the same SLA.

- ##### Corporate-level SLA :
Covering all the generic service level management (often abbreviated as SLM) issues appropriate to every customer throughout the organization. These issues are likely to be less volatile and so updates (SLA reviews) are less frequently required.

- ##### Customer-level SLA :
covering all SLM issues relevant to the particular customer group, regardless of the services being used.

- ##### Service-level SLA :
covering all SLM issue relevant to the specific services, in relation to this specific customer group.
