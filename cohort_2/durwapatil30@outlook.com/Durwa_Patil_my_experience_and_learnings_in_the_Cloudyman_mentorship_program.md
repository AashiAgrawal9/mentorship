 today the speaker explained us the purpose of learning cloud computing  

##### cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. 

Here are seven common reasons organisations are turning to cloud computing services:
- cost  
- speed  
- global scale  
- productivity  
- performance  
- reliability  
- security  

# Types of cloud computing  

Not all clouds are the same and not ontype of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.

First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented on. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud.
