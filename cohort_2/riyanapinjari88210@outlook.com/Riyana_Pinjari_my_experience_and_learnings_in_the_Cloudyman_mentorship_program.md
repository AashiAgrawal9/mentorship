# 1.Introduction To cloud Computing

    Cloud computing consists of three distinct types of computing services delivered remotely to clients via the internet. Clients typically pay a monthly or annual service fee to providers, to gain access to systems that deliver software as a service, platforms as a service and infrastructure as a service to subscribers. Clients who subscribe to cloud computing services can reap a variety of benefits, depending on their particular business needs at a given point in time. The days of large capital investments in software and IT infrastructure are now a thing of the past for any enterprise that chooses to adopt the cloud computing model for procurement of IT services. 
    
# 2.How cloud works
    To understand the workings of a cloud system, it is easier to divide it into two sections: the front end and the back end. They are connected to each other through a network, usually the Internet. The front end is the side of the computer user or client. The back end is ‘the cloud’ section of the system. 
 The front end consists of the client’s computer or computer network. Also the application essential to access the cloud computing system. It is not necessary that all cloud computing systems have the same user interface. 
 On the back end of the cloud technology system, there are various computers, servers and data storage systems that make up the cloud. A cloud computing system could potentially include any computer program, from data processing to video games. Generally, each application will have its own dedicated server. 
 
# 3.Benifits of cloud computing
   #### **1. Reduced IT costs:**
   
  - The cost of system upgrades, new hardware and software may be included in your contract.
  - you no longer need to pay wages for expert staff. 
#### **2. Scalability:**  

 - Your business can scale up or scale down your operation and storage needs quickly to suit your situation, allowing flexibility as your needs change. 
 - Using the cloud frees up your time so you can get on with running your business. 
 
 #### **3. Business continuity:** 
 
 - Protecting your data and systems is an important part of business continuity planning. 
 - Whether you experience a natural disaster, power failure or other crisis, having your data stored in the cloud ensures it is backed up and protected in a secure and safe location. 
 
 #### **4. Flexibility of work practices:** 
 - Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices. For example, you have the ability to access data from home, on holiday, or via the commute to and from work (providing you have an internet connection). 
 - If you need access to your data while you are off-site, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily. 
 
 # 4. Applications of cloud computing: 

 - **Online File storage:** 
 MediaFire, megaupload, hotfile, 4Shared, rapidshare, yourfilehost are such examples which are used to host files including documents, images, presentation, videos, etc. The interface is easy to use, and users can upload and download files from these sites. 
 
 - **Photo editing software:** 
 Picnik, Pixlr, etc. are popular free online photo editing software. This online software has features such as cropping of the image, resizing, rotation based on degrees, special effects, addition and editing features are also included in a GUI (Graphical User Interface) format.
 
 - **E-commerce software:** 
 Cloud based e-application allows users and e-business to respond quickly to market opportunities & challenges the modern e-commerce is facing. It became for business tycoons to focus on the usage of cloud computing without considering the time and effort involved in implementing a reliable solution.  
 
 - **Miscellaneous application:** 
 One of the 1st utilization of free SaaS applications is to check for the status of packages & items. Applications such as UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, etc. provide free tracking of packages online. Another application name - XE provides services online from foreign exchange tools.  
 
 - **Presentation software:** 
 Sliderocket is an online free application to create a presentation. It allows importing of Microsoft's PowerPoint presentations. Since it is a web-based cloud application, the presentations can be accessed from anywhere within the globe. 
 
 - **Word processing application:** 
 Writeboard is another online word processing and document editing application. It has a unique feature that multiple users can access the same document using this application, edit that document and save the document after editing, but the document will have different versions. But it doesn't allow importing the word files.
