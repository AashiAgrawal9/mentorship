## 1.Importance of Markdown language.

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats.The Markdown editor helps you to perform basic editing capabilities: manage headings, apply formatting to text to make it bold or italic, and so on.
  
- Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML or HTML.
  
## 2. Documentation in Markdown Language.

- Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
