Microsoft Azure, formerly known as **Windows Azure**, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud <br/>services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and <br/>scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.

## Microsoft provides five different customer support options for Azure:

- Basic

- Developer

- Standard

- Professional Direct

- Premier


## Microsoft Azure products and services :

## Compute

These services enable a user to deploy and manage VMs, containers and batch jobs, as well as support remote application access. Compute resources created within the Azure cloud can be configured with either public IP addresses or private IP addresses, depending on whether the resource needs to be accessible to the outside world.

## Mobile

These products help developers build cloud applications for mobile devices, providing notification services, support for back-end tasks, tools for building application program interfaces (APIs) and the ability to couple geospatial context with data.

## Web 

These services support the development and deployment of web applications. They also offer features for search, content delivery, API management, notification and reporting.

## Storage 

This category of services provides scalable cloud storage for structured and unstructured data. It also supports big data projects, persistent storage and archival storage.

## Security 

These products provide capabilities to identify and respond to cloud security threats, as well as manage encryption keys and other sensitive assets.

## Databases 

This category includes Database as a Service (DBaaS) offerings for SQL and NoSQL, as well as other database instances -- such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. It also includes Azure SQL Data Warehouse support, caching and hybrid database integration and migration features. Azure SQL is the platform's flagship database service. It is a relational database that provides SQL functionality without the need for deploying a SQL server.

## Networking

This group includes virtual networks, dedicated connections and gateways, as well as services for traffic management and diagnostics, load balancing, DNS hosting and network protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

## Media and content delivery network (CDN)

These CDN services include on-demand streaming, digital rights protection, encoding and media playback and indexing.

## Integration 

These are services for server backup, site recovery and connecting private and public clouds.

Internet of things. These services help users capture, monitor and analyze IoT data from sensors and other devices. Services include notifications, analytics, monitoring and support for coding and execution.

## DevOps

This group provides project and collaboration tools, such as Azure DevOps -- formerly Visual Studio Team Services -- that facilitate DevOps software development processes. It also offers features for application diagnostics, DevOps tool integrations and test labs for build tests and experimentation.

## Security

These products provide capabilities to identify and respond to cloud security threats, as well as manage encryption keys and other sensitive assets.

## Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning

This is a wide range of services that a developer can use to infuse artificial intelligence, machine learning and cognitive computing capabilities into applications and data sets.

## Migration

This suite of tools helps an organization estimate workload migration costs and perform the actual migration of workloads from local data centers to the Azure cloud.

## Management and governance.

These services provide a range of backup, recovery, compliance, automation, scheduling and monitoring tools that can help a cloud administrator manage an Azure deployment.

## Analytic

These services provide distributed analytics and storage, as well as features for real-time analytics, big data analytics, data lakes, machine learning (ML), business intelligence (BI), internet of things (IoT) data streams and data warehousing.

## Azure for DR and backup
Some organizations use Azure for data backup and disaster recovery. Organizations can also use Azure as an alternative to their own data center. Rather than invest in local servers and storage, these organizations choose to run some, or all, of their business applications in Azure.

> ## Uses of Azure

#### Application development:
 You can create any web application in Azure.
#### Testing: 
After developing an application successfully on the platform, you can test it.
#### Application hosting: 
Once the testing is done, Azure can help you host the application.
#### Create virtual machines: 
You can create virtual machines in any configuration you want with the help of Azure. 
#### Integrate and sync features: 
Azure lets you integrate and sync virtual devices and directories. 
#### Collect and store metrics: 
Azure lets you collect and store metrics, which can help you find what works. 
Virtual hard drives: These are extensions of the virtual machines; they provide a huge amount of data storage.
