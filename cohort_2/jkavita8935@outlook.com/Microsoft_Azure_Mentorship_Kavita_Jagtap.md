It also offers features for application diagnostics, DevOps tool integrations and test labs for build tests and experimentation.

## Security

These products provide capabilities to identify and respond to cloud security threats, as well as manage encryption keys and other sensitive assets.

## Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning

This is a wide range of services that a developer can use to infuse artificial intelligence, machine learning and cognitive computing capabilities into applications and data sets.

## Migration

This suite of tools helps an organization estimate workload migration costs and perform the actual migration of workloads from local data centers to the Azure cloud.

## Management and governance.

These services provide a range of backup, recovery, compliance, automation, scheduling and monitoring tools that can help a cloud administrator manage an Azure deployment.

## Analytic

These services provide distributed analytics and storage, as well as features for real-time analytics, big data analytics, data lakes, machine learning (ML), business intelligence (BI), internet of things (IoT) data streams and data warehousing.

## Azure for DR and backup
Some organizations use Azure for data backup and disaster recovery. Organizations can also use Azure as an alternative to their own data center. Rather than invest in local servers and storage, these organizations choose to run some, or all, of their business applications in Azure.

> ## Uses of Azure

#### Application development:
 You can create any web application in Azure.
#### Testing: 
After developing an application successfully on the platform, you can test it.
#### Application hosting: 
Once the testing is done, Azure can help you host the application.
#### Create virtual machines: 
You can create virtual machines in any configuration you want with the help of Azure. 
#### Integrate and sync features: 
Azure lets you integrate and sync virtual devices and directories. 
#### Collect and store metrics: 
Azure lets you collect and store metrics, which can help you find what works. 
Virtual hard drives: These are extensions of the virtual machines; they provide a huge amount of data storage.

 > # Scaling in cloud computing
 
###  Scaling is defined as the ability for an IT resource to handle growing or decreasing demands in a capable manner. It is one of the most popular and beneficial features of cloud computing, as businesses can scale up or down to meet demands based on season, projects, growth and more.

# Vertical scaling :

- #### Vertical is often thought of as the “easier” of the two methods. When scaling a system vertically, you add more power to an existing instance. This can mean more memory (RAM), faster storage such as Solid State Drives (SSDs), or more powerful processors (CPUs).

- #### The reason this is thought to be the easier option is that hardware is often trivial to upgrade on cloud platforms like AWS, where servers are already virtualized. There is also very little (if any) additional configuration you are required to do at the software level.

 ### Example 
 
 - #### To understand vertical scaling, envision a 20-story hotel. Within this hotel, there are countless rooms that guests constantly move in  and out of. There are often spaces available, as not all of the rooms are occupied at the same time. People can easily come and go  because there is space to accommodate them. As long as the capacity of this hotel is not exceeded, there is no issue. This is vertical   scaling.

- #### With computing,we can add or subtract resources, including memory or storage, within a server as long as the resources do not exceed  the capacity of the machine itself. Similar to the hotel example, resources can come and go easily and quickly, as long as there is room for them. Though it has limitations, this is a way to beef up your server and avoid latency and extra management.

# Horizontal scaling :

- #### Horizontal scaling refers to adding more servers to your network, rather than simply adding resources like with vertical scaling. This method tends to take more time and is more complex, but it allows you to connect servers together, handle traffic efficiently and execute concurrent workloads.
 
## Example

#### Imagine a two-lane highway. Cars easily travel in each direction without huge traffic issues. But then the area surrounding the    highway is developed – new buildings are built and traffic increases. Pretty soon, this two-lane highway is clogged with cars, and accidents become commonplace. It’s clear that two-lanes are no longer enough. In order to avoid these issues, more lanes are added and an overpass is constructed. While this takes a significant amount of time, it solves the problem.
 
# Diagonal Scaling :
 
#### Diagonal Scaling allows you to experience the most efficient infrastructure scaling . When we combine vertical and horizontal, we simply grow within our existing server until you hit the capacity. Then, we can clone that server as necessary and continue the process, allowing us to deal with a lot of requests and traffic concurrently.

# which scaling is better?

#### Horizontal scaling is often considered a long term advantage, whereas vertical scaling is usually considered a short term advantage.

#### The reason for this is that you can typically add as many servers as you need to your infrastructure, but at some point, hardware upgrades are just not plausible.

> # Benefits of cloud scalability:

## Scalability :

#### Scalability is the key concept for anyone in the DevOps world. Let’s briefly discuss the benefits of scalability.

## 1· Performance:

#### One core benefit of scalability in the cloud is that it facilitates performance. Scalable architecture has the ability to handle the bursts of traffic and heavy workloads that will come with business growth.

## 2· Cost-efficient:

#### You can allow your business to grow without making any expensive changes in the current setup. This reduces the cost implications of storage growth making scalability in the cloud very cost effective.

## 3. Easy and Quick:

#### Scaling up or scaling out in the cloud is simpler; you can commission additional VMs with a few clicks and after the payment is processed, the additional resources are available without any delay.

## 4· Capacity:

#### Scalability ensures that with the continuous growth of your business the storage space in cloud grows as well. Scalable cloud computing systems accommodate your data growth requirements. With scalability, you don’t have to worry about additional capacity needs.

## 5. Scalability admonition:

#### Scalability also has some limitations. If you want a fully scalable system then you have a large task to handle. It requires planning, testing and again testing for your data storage. If you have the applications already then splitting up the system will require code changes, updates and monitoring. You have to be well prepared for the digital transformation of your infrastructure.
